Production Basic is an Open-Source, Multi-user Business Basic compiler/interpreter and run-time environment. This system is intended to be an alternative to commercially available systems, such as Basic/Four, MAI and Thoroughbred.  Production Basic was designed to load and save to Thoroughbred Basic file formats.  

Features:
  IF/THEN/ELSE testing.
  GOSUB/RETURNs
  FOR/NEXT/STEP loops
  GOTO jumping
  WHILE/WEND loops
  other commonly used BASIC verbs (PRINT, INPUT, LET, etc.)
  Strong substring and string operation mechanism.
  Many standard Business Basic terminal mnemonics implemented.
  User-defined program escape trapping (ESCON/ESCOFF/SETESC).
  Record operations on INDEXED and TEXT external file types.
  Accurate floating point numbers handled internally (don't use normal C floats or doubles).
  User-defined internal functions (DEF FN).
  Public programs with and without parameter lists (CALL/ENTER/EXIT).
  43 internal functions, 50 terminal mnemonics, 12 system variables, 41 verbs
  Modular design and strong runtime engine making it easy to add new internal functions.
