Production BASIC TODO List
--------------------------

These are the main features/changes I would like to see implemented in 
Production BASIC.  Anyone is encouraged to give them a shot, and if you 
get any of them working, please submit a patch.

-- Items Remaining to be Implemented --
- Verbs, functions and system variables not yet implemented
- Data files: SERIAL, DIRECT, SORT, MSORT
- Input mnemonic tables
- Data masking
- Data dictionary and format maintainance
- Transaction processing
- Windows
- Ghost tasks
- Interprocess communication

--- Misc. Improvements ---
* General improvements to parser
* Move more internal tables, etc. to using pointers rather than static arrays
* Better error checking.  I'd like to check the unique syntax of all verbs after  a statement is entered, not when the statement is executed.  
* Expand arithmetic functions & storage structure to use 6 bytes of storage for 
  the mantisa instead of 4 bytes as are currently used.  
* Initialization parameters
* Expand mnemonic table to use multiple terminal types, also make external file.
* SQL Date Functions/Variables: CDN, CDN, NTD, DTN
